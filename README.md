* http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40772

* Choose
	* Windows 7 -- http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
	* Windows 8 -- http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bg162891.aspx

_You may need to uninstall older versions of Microsoft Visual C++ and/or .NET Framework first._

##Setup
* Install the three requirements above.
* Edit blue table in commands.xlsx.  
(This site may help: http://smite.gamepedia.com/Voice_Guided_System)
* Copy built arrays into smitten.ahk editing zone.
* Run smitten.ahk.
* An icon will appear in your System Tray.

##Use
* Tapping left Shift gives a 4 second limit to say a whitelist word.
* Tapping left Shift within 4 seconds terminates the listening early.
* It takes some practice to get used to the timing and recognition delay.
* Good whitelist words help with the delay.
* Exit via System Tray.

**Feel free to tinker!**  
(e.g. Parsing the XLSX as a CSV would prevent the need to copy and paste.)
